# Gmail Automation Ideas - Conversation Log

## Initial Ideas

**Email Management:**
- Auto-archive emails from specific senders (newsletters, notifications)
- Auto-label emails based on content/sender/keywords
- Auto-delete old promotional emails after X days
- Batch unsubscribe from unwanted lists
- Auto-forward specific types to other accounts

**Calendar Integration:**
- Extract event details from emails (confirmations, invites) and create calendar events
- Parse flight/hotel confirmations → travel calendar
- Meeting requests → auto-accept/decline based on availability
- Deadline mentions → reminder events

**Google Drive:**
- Save attachments to specific Drive folders by type/sender
- Archive important emails as PDFs to Drive
- Extract and save order confirmations/receipts
- Create spreadsheets from data-heavy emails

**Summarization/Notes:**
- Daily digest of important emails
- Summarize long email threads
- Extract action items → Google Tasks/Keep
- Weekly report of email metrics
- Meeting notes from email threads → Google Docs

**Advanced Ideas:**
- Auto-respond to common questions
- Smart filtering based on email sentiment
- Integration with other tools (Notion, Todoist)
- Voice notifications for VIP emails

## Intelligent Email Action Assistant Concept

### Core Concept
An email client overlay that analyzes each message and suggests actions with confidence scores:

```
📧 Newsletter from TechCrunch → 📁 Auto-archive (95% confidence)
📧 "Let's meet next Tuesday at 3pm" → 📅 Create calendar event (88% confidence)
📧 Receipt from Amazon → 💾 Save to Drive/Receipts (92% confidence)
📧 Long thread about project → 📝 Summarize & save notes (76% confidence)
```

### Action Categories

**1. Archive/Delete**
- Newsletters, promotions, notifications
- Old automated emails

**2. Calendar Events**
- Meeting invites, appointments
- Deadline mentions, due dates
- Travel confirmations → full itinerary

**3. Document Storage**
- Receipts → Drive/Financial folder
- Contracts → Drive/Legal folder
- Important attachments → categorized folders

**4. Note Creation**
- Meeting summaries
- Action items extraction
- Project decisions

**5. Task Creation**
- "Please do X by Y date"
- Follow-ups needed
- Commitments made

**6. Response Required**
- Questions needing answers
- Time-sensitive requests

### Learning Mechanism

**Implicit Learning:**
- Track which suggestions you accept/reject
- Learn your patterns (e.g., always archive from sender X)
- Time-based patterns (archive newsletters after reading)

**Explicit Feedback:**
- "Always do this for emails like this"
- Correction mechanism when wrong
- Custom rules creation

### UI/UX Concept

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ From: boss@company.com              │
│ Subject: Q4 Planning Meeting Notes  │
│                                     │
│ 🤖 Suggested Actions:               │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ 📝 Extract action items → Tasks │ │

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## LLM-Powered Email Action System

### Core Flow
```
Email → LLM Analysis → Suggested Actions → User Feedback → Learning
```

### LLM Agent Architecture

**1. Email Analyzer Agent**
```typescript
const analyzeEmail = async (email: Email) => {
  const prompt = `
    Analyze this email and suggest actions. Consider:
    - Sender: ${email.from}
    - Subject: ${email.subject}
    - Body: ${email.body}
    - Attachments: ${email.attachments.map(a => a.type)}
    
    Previous actions for this sender: ${userHistory[email.from]}
    
    Suggest actions with confidence scores:
    1. Archive/Delete (if promotional, newsletter, notification)
    2. Calendar Event (if contains meeting/event details)
    3. Save to Drive (if important document/receipt)
    4. Create Task (if action items present)
    5. Summarize (if long thread or important discussion)
    6. Response Needed (if direct question or request)
    
    Return as JSON with reasoning.
  `;
  
  return await claude.analyze(prompt);
}
```

**2. Smart Context Injection**
- User's past actions for similar emails
- Contact importance/frequency
- Time patterns (user tends to archive on Fridays)
- Project/client context

**3. Continuous Learning**
```typescript
// After user accepts/rejects suggestion
const feedback = {
  email_features: extractedFeatures,
  suggested_action: "archive",
  user_action: "accepted",
  confidence: 0.92
};

// Use this to improve future prompts
updateUserProfile(feedback);
```

### Example LLM Prompts

**For Calendar Events:**
```
Extract any date/time information and create a calendar event:
- Event title
- Date/time (handle timezones)
- Duration
- Location
- Attendees
- Description

Email: "Let's meet next Tuesday at 3pm EST at Starbucks on Main St to discuss the Q4 roadmap"
```

**For Smart Summarization:**
```
This email thread has 15 messages about project X. 
Create a summary with:
- Key decisions made
- Action items with owners
- Open questions
- Next steps
```

### Advanced Features

**1. Multi-Step Actions**
```
Flight confirmation email →
- Create calendar events for departure/return
- Save PDF to Drive/Travel
- Add packing reminder 1 day before
- Share itinerary with family
```

**2. Smart Batching**
```
"You have 47 newsletters. I suggest:
- Archive all except these 3 with content you typically read
- Save interesting articles to Drive/Reading List"
```

**3. Proactive Insights**
```
"This looks like a contract renewal. Last year you:
- Saved to Drive/Contracts
- Created a review task 30 days before expiry
- Forwarded to legal team
Should I do the same?"
```

### Implementation Approach

```typescript
class EmailActionAgent {
  async processInbox() {
    const emails = await gmail.getUnreadEmails();
    
    for (const email of emails) {
      // Get LLM suggestions
      const analysis = await this.llm.analyze(email, {
        userPreferences: this.getUserPrefs(),
        historicalActions: this.getHistory(email.from),
        contextualHints: this.getContext(email)
      });
      
      // Present to user
      const actions = await this.ui.showSuggestions(analysis);
      
      // Execute accepted actions
      await this.executeActions(actions);
      
      // Learn from feedback
      await this.updateLearning(email, analysis, actions);
    }
  }
}
```
